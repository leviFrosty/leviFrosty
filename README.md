# 👋 Hi, I’m Levi Wilkerson

I'm a System Admin & Network Engineer turned Software Engineer. 

In 2019, while working as a Sys Admin, I realized how fun and addicting programming was. I started my journey with Powershell applications & AutoIT scripts. I was hooked.

Some time passed, I got my [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/training-certifications/certifications/enterprise/ccna/index.html), then later I began working as a full-stack engineer at [Paula's Choice](https://www.paulaschoice.com/). 3+ years at Paula's Choice and many large projects later, I still am hooked.

**I love software.**

Levi
