# 👋 Hi, I’m Levi Wilkerson!

🧑‍💼 For work, I am a full-stack developer at [Paula's Choice](https://www.paulaschoice.com/).

👨‍💻 For fun, I am working on [JW Time](https://github.com/leviFrosty/JW-Time), a field service productivity app enjoyed by over 700+ weekly active users.

📚 For the brain, I am learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

🚴‍♂️ For more, I enjoy working out, hanging with my lovely wife and friends, and swinging the tennis racket! 🎾

❤️ If you find value in my work and want to support, consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/leviwilkerson)
